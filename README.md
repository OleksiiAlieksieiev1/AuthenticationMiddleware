This is a simple middleware package for authentication in JavaScript. It can be used with Express.js or any other Node.js framework to authenticate requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Installation

```bashnpm install your-authentication-middleware-package
```

## Usage

```javascript
const authenticationMiddleware = require('your-authentication-middleware-package');

// Apply middleware to your Express app
app.use(authenticationMiddleware);
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed before using this package.

## Configuration

The middleware currently expects a JWT token to be passed in the 'Authorization' header of each request. You will need to modify the `Token` function within the code to suit your own token verification logic. Please replace `'your_secret_key'` with an appropriate secret key on your side```javascript
// Function for verifying decoded JWT token 
const verifyToken = (token) => {
  // Implement your own logic here, e.g., using the jsonwebtoken library
  
  const secretKey = 'your_secret_key'; // Replace this key with yours
  
  return jwt.verify, secretKey);
};
```

Please ensure that you handle any errors related to token verification appropriately within this function.
